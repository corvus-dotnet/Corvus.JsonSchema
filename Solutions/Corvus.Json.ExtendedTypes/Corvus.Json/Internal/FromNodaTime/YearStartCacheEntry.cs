    /// only supports a number of ticks since the Unix epoch of between long.MinValue and long.MaxValue,
    /// we only need to support a number of days in the range
    /// [long.MinValue / TicksPerDay, long.MaxValue / TicksPerDay] which is [-10675200, 10675200] (rounding
    /// away from 0). This value can be stored in 25 bits.

    /// 10 bits are used as the index into the cache (which is an array). The next 7 most significant
    /// bits are stored in the entry. So long as we have fewer than 17 significant bits in the year value,
    /// this will be a unique combination. A single validation value (the most highly positive value) is
    /// reserved to indicate an invalid entry. The cache is initialized with all entries invalid.

    /// contrast, the ISO calendar years are in the range [-27255, 31195] - so we'd have to be dealing with a
