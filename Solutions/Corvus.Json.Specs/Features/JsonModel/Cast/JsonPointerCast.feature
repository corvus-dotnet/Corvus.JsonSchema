Scenario: Cast to JsonAny for json element backed value as a relativePointer
	Given the JsonElement backed JsonRelativePointer "0/foo/bar"
	When I cast the JsonRelativePointer to JsonAny
	Then the result should equal the JsonAny "0/foo/bar"

Scenario: Cast to JsonAny for dotnet backed value as a relativePointer
	Given the dotnet backed JsonRelativePointer "0/foo/bar"
	When I cast the JsonRelativePointer to JsonAny
	Then the result should equal the JsonAny "0/foo/bar"

Scenario: Cast from JsonAny for json element backed value as a relativePointer
	Given the JsonAny for "0/foo/bar"
	When I cast the JsonAny to JsonRelativePointer
	Then the result should equal the JsonRelativePointer "0/foo/bar"

Scenario: Cast to JsonString for json element backed value as a relativePointer
	Given the JsonElement backed JsonRelativePointer "0/foo/bar"
	When I cast the JsonRelativePointer to JsonString
	Then the result should equal the JsonString "0/foo/bar"
